          <h2>The Parietal Lobe</h2>
          <p>Named after the bone that covers this area of the brain, the Parietal lobe is located closer to the back of the brain, above the Temporal Lobe. It is home to the primary somatosensory cortex area which is involved with the processing of sensory information through different parts of the body. There is an area in this cortex for each body part such as lips, arms, legs and feet. The Parietal Lobe is also involved with spatial awareness and navigation.</p>

          <h3>The primary somatosensory cortex</h3>
            <p>The somatosensory cortex helps us to process sensory information such as temperature, pain and position of our limbs. For example, if you close your eyes you still know where your legs and arms are and what position they're in. You don't need to look at them to know where they are, you sense that they're in that position.

      <h3>Spatial Awareness and Navigation</h3>
        <p>The Parietal Lobe doesn't just provide senses for our own body position in space. It can also help with spatial awareness, such as knowing where is left, right, up and down which helps with co-ordinating movements. Sports professionals are known to have good spatial awareness. Furthermore, there are areas in the parietal lobe which are part of neural pathways active during navigation.</p>
