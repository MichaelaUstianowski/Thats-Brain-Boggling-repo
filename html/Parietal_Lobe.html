        <p>Named after the bone that covers this area of the brain, the Parietal lobe is located closer to the back of the brain, above the Temporal Lobe. It is home to the somatosensory cortex area which is involved with the processing of sensory information through different parts of the body. There is an area in this cortex for each body part such as lips, arms, legs and feet. The Parietal Lobe is also involved with spatial awareness and navigation.
