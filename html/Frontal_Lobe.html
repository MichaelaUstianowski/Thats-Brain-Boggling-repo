          <h2>The Frontal Lobe</h2>
          <p>The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain and is known as the 'control centre' of the brain. It is associated with higher level functions such as: planning and sequencing actions, impulse control, attention, personality, problem solving, reasoning and speech production. It is also home to the premotor cortex, which is involved with body movement.

      <h3>Planning and Sequencing</h3>
        <p>
          People who have injured their frontal lobe could struggle with planning or organising their behaviour. An example of how we can test our <a id="cognitive-planning" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="Cognitive Planning" data-content="An executive function which is involved with the formulation, evaluation and selection of thoughts or actions to achieve a goal">cognitive planning</a> is through a game called the Tower of Hanoi. <a href = "http://www.webgamesonline.com/towers-of-hanoi/index.php">Click here</a> to play the Tower of Hanoi! This task tests our ability to anticipate what actions we need to do next in order to achieve a goal, which is what planning is. <br>Furthermore, there are some people who struggle with sequencing actions. For example, an individual who struggles with sequencing could make a cup of tea in the wrong order, or forget a sequence of events that happened in their past.</br>

      <h3>Attention</h3>
        <p>
          There is a disorder called Environmental Dependency Syndrome which can occur in people with frontal lobe <a id="lesions" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="Lesions" data-content="a region in an organ or tissue which has suffered damage through injury or disease, such as a wound, ulcer, abscess, or tumour.">lesions</a> where patients' behvaiours are controlled by environmental <a id="Stimuli" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="Stimuli" data-content="An object or event that evokes a specific functional reaction in an organ or tissue.">stimuli</a>. One of the common symptoms of this is lack of attention. They may start a task but become distracted and not finish. A common way we can test your attention is through using a Stroop task. During the stroop task, the participant is asked to identify the colour of the word presented. The trick is that the words are of colours such as "red" or "blue" but may not be printed in that colour. We have to selectively attend to the font colour, not be distracted by the word itself and control our impulses to read the word. Findings from this test show that it takes longer to identify the colour of a word if they don't match. For example, if the word "red" is presented in blue ink, it takes longer to identify the colour of the word than if "red" was the colour red.

          Have a go for yourself! Above are two sets of words printed in different colours. For each set, read the font colours out loud as quickly as possible. Use a stopwatch to time yourself. What times did you get? Which set was quicker? Did you make any mistakes?

        <h3>Personality and Impulse Control</h3>
          <p>
            There is a particular case in the 1800s of a man called Phineas Gage who survived an injury to the frontal lobe. His close friends and wife stated his personality changed from a hard-working and respectable individual to a man who was mean, impatient and lazy. Below is a video about the case. However, despite this link, the association between personality and the frontal lobe is a lot more complicated when investigated more thoroughly. Some may argue that Phineas lost some impulse control, as he would continue to be rude to others when that is not really socially acceptable. Furthermore, people who have Environmental Dependency Syndrome, they could have trouble controlling impulsive behaviour. For example, a patient at dinner in a public place may see someone in the kitchen washing up and join in.

          <h3>Speech Production</h3>
            <p>There is an area in the frontal Lobe, called Broca's area. This area and its function was discovered by Physician Paul Broca. Paul worked with a couple of patients who had injuries to this are of the brain and found that they could not speak and found difficulties writing too. However speech comprehension was intact. The video below summarises what Broca's area is.
