          <h2>The Occipital Lobe</h3>
            <p>The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain and is responsible for processing visual stimuli and is home to the primary visual cortex. The occipital lobe is involved in the processing of colour, motion of objects and is involved with object recognition and location.</p>

          <h3>The Primary Visual Cortex</h3>
            <p>The primary visual cortex (V1) is the first place the visual information arrives, ready to be processed by the brain. V1 sends signals to other areas in the occipital cortex, responsible of processing different aspects of the stimuli that has just been seen. In experiments, <a id="V2" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="V2" data-content="The secondary visual cortex is repsonsible for the feedforward of information to other areas of the brain such as V3, V4 and V5.

            <h3>Processing colour and motion</h3>
              <p>V1 sends information to other areas in the occipital lobe. In 1993, a scientist called Zeki conducted experiments to investigate how the brain processes visual stimuli, through using <a id="PET" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="PET" data-content="Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are used to produce detailed 3-dimensional images of the inside of the body. The scan uses a special dye containing radioactive tracers. These tracers are either swallowed, inhaled, or injected into a vein in your arm depending on what part of the body is being examined.The images can clearly show the part of the body being investigated, including any abnormal areas, and can highlight how well certain functions of the body are working.">PET</a> scans.
               When participants were processing the colour of shapes, Zeki found that V1, V2 and <a id="V4" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="V4" data-content="Visual area 4 is located in the extrastriate visual cortex and has been found to be associated with the identification of colour and object orientation.">V4</a> were active during this condition. When participants were watching moving shapes, V1, V2 and <a id="V5" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="V5" data-content="This is known as the Middle Temporal visual area and is associated with motion perception. ">V5</a> were active.  This suggests there are specific areas that are involved in processing visual stimuli. Although V5 is not in the occipital lobe, there are significant pathways from the occipital lobe connected to V5, allowing information to be processed in more detail. As seen, V4 is inside the brain whereas V5 is on the outside.

            <h3>Object recognition and location</h3>
            <p>The brain acts similarly during object recognition and object location. There are specific areas which can address aspects of an object such as colour and if it is moving, but this information is passed further into other lobes of the brain to be processed. To name objects, the information travels from V1 to areas in the temporal lobe and to locate objects, the information travels from V1 to areas in the parietal lobe. These pathways are known as the "What/Where pathways".
