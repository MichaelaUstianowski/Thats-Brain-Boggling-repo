      <h2>The Occipital Lobe</h3>
       <img src="../images/occipital-lobe.jpg" alt="this is the occipital lobe">
       <p>The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain and is responsible for processing visual stimuli and is home to the <a href ="Glossary.html#Primary-Visual-cortex">primary visual cortex</a>. The occipital lobe is involved in the processing of colour, motion of objects and is involved with object recognition and location.</p>
        <h3>The Primary Visual Cortex</h3>
          <p>The >primary visual cortex (V1)</a> is the first place the visual information arrives, ready to be processed by the brain. V1 sends signals to other areas in the occipital cortex, responsible of processing different aspects of the stimuli that has just been seen. In experiements, <a href="Glossary.html#V2">V2</a> was also seen active during the processing of all visual stimuli.
          </p>

        <h3>Processing colour and motion</h3>
          <p>V1 sends information to other areas in the occipital lobe. In 1993, a scientist called Zeki conducted experiments to investigate how the brain processes visual stimuli, through using <a href="Glossary.html#PET">PET</a> scans. When participants were processing the colour of shapes, Zeki found that V1, V2 and <a href ="Glossary.html#V4">V4</a> were active during this condition. When participants were watching moving shapes, V1, V2 and <a href="Glossary#V5">V5</a> were active. This suggests there are specific areas that are involved in processing visual stimuli. As seen above, V4 is inside the brain whereas V5 is on the outside.

        <h3>Object recognition and location</h3>
          <p>The brain acts similarly during object recognition and object location. There are specific areas which can address aspects of an object such as colour and if it is moving, but this information is passed further into other lobes of the brain to be processed. To name objects, the information travels from V1 to areas in the temporal lobe and to locate objects, the information travels from V1 to areas in the parietal lobe. These pathways are known as the "What/Where pathways".
