      <h2>Other Areas of the Brain</h2>
        <p>There are other areas, which are further inside of the brain or are not part of the four lobes but are still important. They may be responsible for sending messages to other parts of the body, important areas involved in emotion processing or invovled in the formation of long term memories. Here these areas will be explained more fully.</p>
          <h3>The Cerebellum and Brainstem</h3>
          <img src="../images/brainstem-and-cerebllum.png" alt="this is the brainstem and the cerebellum">
            <h4>The Brainstem</h4>
              <p>The Brainstem is an important part of the brain as it is the only connection between our brains and bodies. Is can send messages from our body to our brain which processes the sensory information such as touch, pressure or temperature for example. It also is involved with respiration control, consciousness and cardiovascular system control.
              </p>
            <h4>The Cerebellum</h4>
              <p>There Cerebellum is a small part of the brain which is connected to the Brainstem at the back of the head. It's responsible for the proecessing of sensory information but also regulates balance, voluntary motor movements, coordination and regulates speech.

          <h3>The Amygdala</h3>
            <p> The Amygdala is a small part of the brain located in the Temporal lobe and is a part of the Limbic System. The Amygdala is associated with emotional processing and learning, the formation of emotional memories and is involved in the reward system. The video below provides more information on the Amygdala.

          <h3>The Hippocampus</h3>
            <p>The Hippocampus is also a part of the Limbic System and is said to resemble a seahorses in each hemisphere. The Hippocampus is associated with the formation and consolidation of new memories as well as recalling long term memories. This is because when the Hippocampus is dammaged on both sides of the brain, patients can experience suffered dammage to their Hippocampus.
