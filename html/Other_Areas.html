        <h2>Other Areas of the Brain</h2>
          <p>There are other areas, which are further inside of the brain or are not part of the four lobes but are still important. They may be responsible for sending messages to other parts of the body, important areas involved in emotion processing or involved in the formation of long term memories. Here these areas will be explained more fully.</p>

                <h4>The Brainstem</h4>
                  <p>The Brainstem is an important part of the brain as it is the only connection between our brains and bodies. It can send messages from our body to our brain which processes the sensory information such as touch, pressure or temperature for example. It also is involved with respiration control, consciousness and cardiovascular system control.
                  </p>
                  <h4>The Cerebellum</h4>
                  <p>There Cerebellum is a small part of the brain which is connected to the Brainstem at the back of the head. It's responsible for the processing of sensory information but also regulates balance, voluntary motor movements, coordination and speech.

            <h3>The Amygdala</h3>
              <p> The Amygdala is a small part of the brain located in the Temporal lobe and is a part of the <a id="limbic-system" href"#" tabindex="-1" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" title="Limbic System" data-content="The Limbic system is the part of the brain involved in our behavioural and emotional responses, especially when it comes to behaviours we need for survival such as feeding, reproduction, caring for our young and fight or flight responses. Two of the main areas of this system are the Amygdala and Hippocampus.">Limbic System.</a> The Amygdala is associated with emotional processing and learning, the formation of emotional memories and is involved in the reward system. This video provides more information on the Amygdala.

              <p>The Hippocampus is also a part of the Limbic System and is said to resemble a seahorse. The Hippocampus is associated with the formation and consolidation of new memories as well as recalling long term memories. This video provides more information on the Hippocampus.
