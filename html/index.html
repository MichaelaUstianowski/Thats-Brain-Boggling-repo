        The brain is made of cells called <a href = "Glossary.html#Neurons">neurons</a> which send electrical messages all over the brain. The <a href = "Glossary.html#Cerebral-Cortex">cerebral cortex</a> has two <a href = "Glossary.html#Hemispheres">hemispheres</a> and four areas which are responsible for different processes. Hover over the brain to find out the names of these areas.

      <p>The hemispheres of the brain are associated with different functions. For example, the left side is more associated with language, logic and reasoning but the right is more associated with creativity. Even more weirdly, the left side of the brain controls the actions of the right side of the body, whereas the right side of the brain controls the movements of your left side of the body. Depsite the idea of being right or left brained, we use both halves in connection. The hemipshere are connected by a colelction nerve fibers called the <a href="Glossary.html#Corpus-collosum">Corpus Collosum</a> which allows messages to be passed to each hemipshere. The video below is about a patient who had had his corpus colosum cut, due to his severe epilepsy. It provides a quite interesting insight into how each hemisphere functions separately.
